        "Details":"Cat Chow Adult Special Care Sterilized was specially designed for sterilized cats. Before sterilization, the cat's metabolism regulates the need for energy, and the cat will only eat enough to satisfy this need. After sterilization, this self-regulation process is affected, and the cat will eat more than it needs, which will quickly lead to obesity. Even just 48 hours after sterilization, the amount of food eaten will increase by 20% while the energy requirement will decrease by 30%. A low level of carbohydrates can lead to a slight increase in blood sugar and thus avoid the premature feeling of hunger.",
